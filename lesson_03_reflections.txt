When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
# When collaborating wtih others. 
# When publishing.
# As a backup? 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
# Might not want everything published yet.
# Avoid unnecesary commits to GitHub?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
# Branches - concept on single repo. When you want new features, bug fixes etc, on the original project.
# Clone - Cloning into local allows you to work offline. Allows multiple people to work on the same project.  
# Fork - Cloning within GitHub. 
#        Attribution. When you want to potential contribute to the original project but don't have permission to change it. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
# Get latest changes.
# Git can work offline. So you could totes merge say, even if you're on an airplane. 
# Keep in mind what others could potentially be working on? 
# Branch from latest? 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
# Other repo hosting services? 
# Drop..box??? O_O
# One person/change at a time? =/
