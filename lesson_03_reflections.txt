When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
# When collaborating wtih others. 
# When publishing.
# As a backup? 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
# Might not want everything published yet.
# Avoid unnecesary commits to GitHub?
